iPython notebook of a side project I did to learn how to work with Twitter data

What was the world saying on Twitter the morning after the Nov. 13th, 2015 attacks in Paris?

In the fall of 2015, I happened to be living in France for several months. I was also starting to learn Python, 
and was teaching myself how to handle Twitter data using many excellent online tutorials (links are included in the notebook). I had learned how to build a listener to gather tweets in real time on subjects of my choice (this is not included here), so 
when I woke up to the awful news of the Paris attacks on the morning of November 14th, I turned it on and gathered 
tweets with the hashtags: #ParisAttacks, #Paris and #NousSommesUnis. In about an hour, I gathered 1GB of data. The code below is me exploring the data and doing a very simple sentiment analysis on it.
